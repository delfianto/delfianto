# 👋 Hey there, I’m Dewey!

I build stuff, break stuff, automate stuff, and occasionally write funny sarcastic comments in code reviews and commit messages. Linux is my home 🐧, the JVM is where I spill coffee, sweat, and blood ☕💀, Rust is my shiny new toy, and cats… well, cats rule everything.

## 🛠️ Tools & Gizmos

* **Languages & Frameworks:**
  Java, [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) | [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) — for all the boring enterprise stuff
* **Scripting & Hacks:**
  ZSH, Ruby — because why not automate your coffee machine too? ☕
* **Automation & CLI Projects:**
  Currently exploring **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)** for over-engineered but extremely satisfying CLI tools
* **Linux & OSS:**
  Linux user since forever, started with Slackware, ended up with EndeavourOS
* **Homelab & Self-Hosting:**
  Mini homelabs are my playgrounds, self-hosting is my therapy

## 🚀 Show & Tell

Here are some toys I’ve been tinkering with:
* [`compose`](https://github.com/delfianto/compose)
  A magical box of Docker compose files, configs, and scripts to wrangle my self-hosted chaos.
* [`eppcli`](https://github.com/delfianto/eppcli)
  Rusty little tool to tweak AMD Zen EPP profiles.
* [`hyprdrive`](https://github.com/delfianto/hyprdrive)
  CLI app launcher for Hyprland. I may have gone a bit too far here… but it’s fun! 🚀
* New links will be added once I stop hiding them from the world!

## 🤖 Fun Shenanigans

* 🧩 [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) is an endless rabbit hole
