# 👋 Hi, I'm Dewey!

I'm a passionate **Software Engineer** who loves building robust solutions on the JVM stack—primarily with **Java**, **Groovy**, and a touch of **Kotlin**. My main playgrounds are **Spring Boot** and **Micronaut**, but I also enjoy scripting with **ZSH** and **Ruby**.

> “Sharing our collective knowledge benefits us all.”

I believe in the power of open source and knowledge sharing. Whether it’s contributing code, helping others, or learning something new, I’m always eager to be part of the community.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Interests

- **Languages & Frameworks:**  
  Java, [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org), [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) | [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/)
- **Scripting:**  
  ZSH, Ruby
- **Automation & CLI tools:**  
  Currently exploring **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)** for personal CLI and automation projects.
- **Linux & OSS:**  
  Proud Linux user since early 2000 and open-source/free software enthusiast.
- **Homelab & Self-hosting:**  
  I love tinkering with mini homelab setups and running various self-hosted services on my machines.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

Here are a few repositories I'm excited about (coming soon!):

- [`compose`](https://github.com/delfianto/compose)  
  Collection of compose files, configs, and various scripts that I use in my self-hosted environment.

- [`eppcli`](https://github.com/delfianto/eppcli)  
  A CLI tool for managing AMD Zen EPP (Energy Performance Preference) profiles. I use this small project to dip my toes into Rust.

- [`hyprdrive`](https://github.com/delfianto/hyprdrive)  
  Another learning medium to try more advanced features in Rust. This is perhaps a somewhat over-engineered CLI-based process launcher that I built for my Hyprland environment.
